v0.2a

- Fixed a serious bug that made the script break for file paths with
  forward slashes. It seems that forward slashes are quite common
  in file paths!
- Added a "autoscroll" control
- Set the file text to be rendered inside an iframe. Take that, web designers!

  TODO:

  - Enable custom update interval configuration

v0.1a

- First!
