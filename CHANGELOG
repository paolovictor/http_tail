v0.4a 
 
- Now (sort of) works on Firefox. Autoscroll is still broken, though.
  Thanks to Thomas Bindsuz for his writeup on the iframe problem I had:

v0.3a

- Fixed a bug on the template loader that made it look for the template on
  the current directory instead of the scripts's directory

v0.2a

- Fixed a serious bug that made the script break for file paths with
  forward slashes. It seems that forward slashes are quite common
  in file paths!
- Added an "autoscroll" control
- Set the file text to be rendered inside an iframe. Take that, web designers!

v0.1a

- First!
